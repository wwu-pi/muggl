 * Abstract instruction with some concrete methods for instructions that have no

 * reasons. The execution of them simple does not change anything to the current
 * virtual machine state, only the pc is increaed by 1 after the execution has been
 * finished.
 *
 * Concrete instructions can be extended from this class.
