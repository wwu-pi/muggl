/**
 * This abstract class is a container for fields; it offers a Hashtable that stores
 * instances of Field as well as their corresponding values. If also offers the
 * functionality to get values from fields and to put values to fields.<br />
 * <br />
 * It is extends by the concrete classes InitializedClass and Objectref; the first
 * offers access to static fields (and is responsible for the instructions getstatic
 * and putstatic), while the second one offers access to instance fields (and is
 * responsible for the instructions getfield and putfield).<br />
 * <br />
 * For getting fields, lazy initialization is implemented. When statically initializing
 * a class only those static fields are initialized that are explicitly put in the
 * static initializer (the &lt;clinit&gt; method). The same applies for instance
 * initialization: Only those fields are initialized that are explicitly put in the
 * instance initializer (constructor, the chosen &lt;init%gt; method). As a consequence,
 * fields that have not been initialized yet might be accessed during the execution
 * of a program. In that case, the accessed value will simply be initialized to its
 * default value. This might lead to some overhead at runtime, it still is overall
 * faster and less memory-consuming than statically initializing all fields to
 * their default values.
