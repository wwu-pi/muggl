	 * Eliminate solutions by their coverage of def-use chains and/or control graph edges. Basically, the set
	 * of test cases just has to include a number of tests that will have any def-use chain and/or control
	 * flow edge covered at least once during execution. This method tries to find the minimal set of test
	 * cases.
	 *
	 * In order not to waste ressources, it operates a 'greedy' algorithm. A heuristical algorithm will be
	 * used. It picks the solution first that covers the most def-use chains (this strategy is called "greedy"
	 * in the literature). If there is more than one solution with and equal number of def-use chains covered,
	 * the one is picked that covers more control-flow edges. Then the solutions is picked that covers most of
	 * the remaining def-use-chains, again applying the control-flow coverage as the second criterion. This is
	 * continued until all chains are covered. If any control-flow edges are not picked by then, the algorithm
	 * will continue to add those solutions that offer the coverage of yet not picked control flow edges, again
	 * working in a "greedy" way until the set of solution picks all chains and edges.
	 *
	 * Solutions not picked are discarded, as there will not be any reference to them.
	 *
	 * If either elimination by def-use chain or control flow coverage is disabled, only the other criterion
	 * will be used.
	 *
	 * This method will occasionally check the SolutionProcessor for its interruption status. Should it have
	 * been interrupted, processing will stop and a InterruptedException will be thrown.
	 *
	 * PLEASE NOTE: If you decide to free solutions from redundancy (i.e. delete solutions with same
	 * parameters and return values), this should be done before invoking this algorithm. There is no need to
	 * do it after it was run as redundant solutions will not survive the elimination process anyway.
	 *
