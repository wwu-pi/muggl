/**
 * This class implements the iterative deepening depth first algorithm.<br />
 * <br />
 * The algorithm basically works like the depth first search algorithm.
 * However, with each branch the currently reached depth is counted. When
 * reaching a depth that equal the predefined starting depth, no more
 * deepening is done and the algorithm tracks back, as if the depth first
 * algorithm would have reached a leaf node.<br />
 * <br />
 * If every node has been visited and the algorithm has not been aborted,
 * execution will be restarted, with the maximum depth incremented by a
 * predefined value. This will be done until the algorithm has either been
 * aborted, or there is no more deepening possible.<br />
 * <br />
 * In general, depth first can take too much time to find solutions as it
 * might branch too deep and wastes time without finding solutions.
 * Iterative deepening surely has an overhead, as with an increased depth
 * execution has to be redone for the already visited tree. However, it
 * combines the strength of breadth first to not get lost in deep branches
 * without solutions with the small memory footprint of depth first.
