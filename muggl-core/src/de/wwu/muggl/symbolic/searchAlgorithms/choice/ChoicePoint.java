/**
 * Interface for choice points. It defines methods to be implemented by any choice point used in
 * this application. It hence has to be implemented by any concrete implementation, regardless of
 * the number of possible jump targets or choices.<br />
 * <br />
 * Choice points are not necessarily conditional jumps. Instructions that have choice points
 * generated may not lead to jumps in the control flow at all or may even enforce jumping on any
 * execution. Choice points are hence used to make sure execution will track back to them and
 * something in the state space will change in comparison to the first pass before the execution is
 * continued.<br />
 * <br />
 * The typical life cycle of a choice point can be considered to be like this:
 * <ul>
 * <ol>
 * 1. Generation of the choice point with some initial values.
 * </ol>
 * <ol>
 * 2. Addition of further values.
 * </ol>
 * <ol>
 * 3. Continued execution with the first choice's state.
 * </ol>
 * <ol>
 * 4. Backtracking due to the end of the execution or another trigger.
 * </ol>
 * <ol>
 * 5. Checking if this choice point has another solution. => End of life if no solution is found.
 * Control is given to the parent choice point.
 * </ol>
 * <ol>
 * 6. Restoring of the state that the machine was in when generating the choice point, before
 * actually finishing execution of the choice point's instruction.
 * </ol>
 * <ol>
 * 7. Calling changeToNextChoice().
 * </ol>
 * <ol>
 * 8. Usage of the choice point to adapt the state to the situation after the choice point's
 * instruction has been executed.
 * </ol>
 * <ol>
 * 9. Continued execution until 4. occurs.
 * </ol>
 * </ul>
