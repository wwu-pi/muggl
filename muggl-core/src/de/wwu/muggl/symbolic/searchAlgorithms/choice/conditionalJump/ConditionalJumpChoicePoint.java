/**
 * A ConditionalJumpChoicePoint is generated whenever a conditional jump statement is reached.
 * Conditional jumps branch the execution tree, leaving two possibilities: Continue at the next
 * instruction in the program flow, or jump to another instruction. To execute a program
 * symbolically, ChoicePoints are set during execution. By using a search algorithm ChoicePoints can
 * be used to track back in the program flow and visit alternative branches in the execution tree.
 * This does not only safe computation time, but enables the effective visiting of different
 * branches at all, since ChoicePoints safe information about what branch has already been visited.<br />
 * <br />
 * Search algorithms usually extend this class in order to have choice points that offer the
 * functionality needed by them.
