/**
 * Interface for generator providers.<br />
 * <br />
 * Generators are unlikely to have empty constructors. They will have a constructor
 * that accepts arguments and or multiple constructors to offer customizability.
 * In order to be able to utilize a generator with customizable settings and not
 * having the need to put the setting into the generator itself, generators cannot
 * be directly used but need an appropriate GeneratorProvider that instantiates
 * them. These providers have to implement this interface and to have an empty
 * constructor in order to be accepted as feasible providers.
