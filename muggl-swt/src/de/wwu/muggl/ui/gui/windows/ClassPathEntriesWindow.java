/**
 * The ClassPathEntriesWindow shows the currently set class path entries. A class path
 * entry might be a directory or a jar file. The first class path entry is statically and
 * can only be read in this window; any other entry might be deleted, as well as new entries
 * can be added. There can never be a duplicated entry.<br />
 * <br />
 * The class path entries are used when the class loader tries to fetch a new class. It
 * will only find classes that can be either found within the java environment jar files
 * or any of the class path directories / jar files. Hence it is important that a proper
 * class path is set prior to the execution of a method. Basically, the class path should
 * match the class path that was used during the development time. This means, that any
 * utilized projects or libraries have to have own class path entries. The directory
 * structure of the projects class files (usually /bin) has to match the structure of the
 * source file (usually /src) and reflect the packages used. This also applies to other
 * directories on the class path: the proper root of a directory structure has to be
 * selected (this again usually is /bin) since the class loader will treat any directory
 * beneath this as if it was a part of the package name.<br />
 * <br />
 * Example:<br />
 * C:/java_project/bin is added to the class path. The class "myprog.tools.Gui" would now
 * be expected to be at C:/java_project/bin/myprog/tools/Gui.class on the file system.
 * Adding just the project directory (C:/java_project/) would lead to the file being
 * expected to be at C:/java_project/myprog/tools/Gui.class, resulting in a
 * ClassNotFoundException should it actually be accessed.<br />
 * <br />
 * Please note that selecting a class that does not have a /bin directory in its path
 * will only have its own directory added to the class path. Any other directories have
 * to be added manually.
