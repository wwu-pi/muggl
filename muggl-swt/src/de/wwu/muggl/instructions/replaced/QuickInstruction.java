/**
 * Interface for classes representing a java bytecode instruction that can be used to replace other
 * instructions at runtime to optimize execution speed.<br />
 * <br />
 * Some instructions require computationally expensive actions to be taken at runtime. This for
 * example includes getting elements from the constant pool. Quite a lot of these expensive
 * operations have to be done every time an instruction is encountered. Hence, it is a good idea to
 * save the result of the operation and use it the next time the instruction is encountered. The
 * results will be saved to a new instruction which is the "quick" version of the original
 * instruction. This interface marks those quick instructions.
