 * implemented by each instruction class, it should implement one (or more) of the Jump* interfaces
 * from the control subpackage and it may implement the LocalVariableAccess interface to signal that
 * it will access the local variables if executed. Marker interface with regard to the data access
 * are provided by the data subpackage.Studentenbetreuung
