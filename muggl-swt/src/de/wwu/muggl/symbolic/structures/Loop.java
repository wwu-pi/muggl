/**
 * A Loop symbolizes a sequence of instructions that form a loop in the program flow.
 * Since loops are always characterized by conditional jumps in the backward direction,
 * the sequence of instructions start at to and runs to from inclusively.<br />
 *<br />
 * For each Loop there is a count. Each time the instruction at pc from is reached and
 * the backward jump is actually taken, the counter is increased by one. Otherwise, the
 * counter should be reseted. The method isCountGreaterEqual() can be used to check
 * whether a maximum has been reached already.<br />
