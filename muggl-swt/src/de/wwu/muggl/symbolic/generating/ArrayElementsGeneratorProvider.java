/**
 * Interface for array elements generator providers.
 *
 * Array elements generators are unlikely to have empty constructors. They will
 * have a constructor that accepts arguments and or multiple constructors to offer
 * customizability. In order to be able to utilize a generator with customizable
 * settings and not having the need to put the setting into the generator itself,
 * generators cannot be directly used but need an appropriate GeneratorProvider
 * that instantiates them. These providers have to implement this interface and
 * to have an empty constructor in order to be accepted as feasible providers.
 *
 * @see de.wwu.muggl.symbolic.generating.ArrayElementsGenerator
 * @author Tim Majchrzak
 * @version 1.0.0, 2010-03-11
