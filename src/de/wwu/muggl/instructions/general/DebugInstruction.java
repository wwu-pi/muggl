 * Abstract instruction with some concrete methods for debug instructions. Concrete instructions can
 * be extended from this class.<br />
 * <br />
 * Debug instructions should not be found in class files since they are only meant to be set by
 * debuggers and similar tools during the inspection of an application. They can be parsed, but
 * execution will by default fail with an ExecutionException / SymbolicExecutionException being
 * thrown. Concrete classes might override this behavior and for example only log a warning.
