/**
 * Interface for generators that the symbolic virtual machine may use.
 *
 * Generators are used to provide means of generation input parameters for methods where
 * random inputs are not feasible. Generated values are useful in two cases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If unbound variables can be replaced with constrained ones or even with constant values.
 *   Any constraint to the parameters of a methods will speed up execution as the number of
 *   branches in the search tree will be reduced. With the possibility to generate choice points,
 *   an arbitrary number of constrained variables or constants can be tested.</li>
 * <li>If complex data structures are needed. Imagine an algorithm that processes some kind
 *   of trees. Let us say the tree is a binary one. Random symbolic execution would mean that
 *   most inputs for the tree parameter will be useless (yet syntactically correct). To save
 *   execution time and to get good results, a generator could be used to generate a symbolic
 *   binary tree. Should it be too complex to generate a symbolic tree, the generator could be
 *   used to generate partly or non symbolic binary trees. Execution will be done with those
 *   trees and whenever execution with one tree is finished, tracking back will take place and
 *   the next (probably different) tree can be used for execution. Eventually, satisfying
 *   results will be found. These results might be found with random input either but this
 *   could take significantly longer or the found parameters would be strange. To complete the
 *   example: Non binary trees could be used to correctly test a binary tree algorithm but the
 *   test cases generated for that would not be comprehensible for humans as they would look
 *   weird.</li>
 * </ul>
