/**
 * This class wraps a TestCaseSolution in order to ease the elimination process when
 * generating the final set test cases. It therefore contains a TestCaseSolution
 * and forwards the methods to get the def-use and control flow coverage mappings.
 * It introduced two additional fields. They are uses to store the number of def-use
 * chains and control graph edges which are covered by the solution wrapped. If
 * another solution was picked to be included in the final set of test cases, this
 * numbers can be decreased as they only have to reflect the number of yet uncovered
 * chains and edges, i.e. those, that are not covered by the already picked solution(s)
 * but are covered by the one wrapped here.<br />
 * <br />
 * Keeping track of these numbers means some initial effort and decreasing them after
 * picking a solution is a rather slow process. However, finding the next suitable
 * solution is sped up greatly. This justifies the minor increase in memory needed
 * for these wrapper objects.<br />
 * <br />
 * Note: this class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals.<br />
 * <br />
 * The class has package visibility only as it is meant to be utilized by the
 * SolutionProcessor.
