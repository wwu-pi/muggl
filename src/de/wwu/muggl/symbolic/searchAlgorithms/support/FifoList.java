/**
 * A FifoList offers a List that takes elements of type T and implements the first-in-first-out
 * principle. It has two operations:
 * add: A new element is added as the newest element of the list. It will be the latest element
 * to be returned before the list becomes empty.
 * get: The oldest element will be returned and the list will then either become empty, or the
 * element added after the oldest element will become the oldest one.
 *
 * The FifoList uses entries of type FifoListEntry internally. This is transparent for the usage.
 *
 * A FifoList should be parameterized so it will only process the desired type.
 *
 * @param <T> The type stored in this FifoList.
